    On the island Sophie found the interesting round amulet.
    Along the perimeter of the amulet has a small points through each degree (total 360).
    Also the amulet has three levers with different lengths
    (first is the shortest, second is middle and third is the longest).
    Levers can be rotated. If you rotate one lever, then rotate and others.
    The levers rotate discretely by degrees. Clockwise direction is a positive angle. Counterclockwise is a negative.
</p>

<p>
    After some experiments Sophie discovers the levers correlation. If you rotate a lever, then other rotate in the same direction but with different speed.
    If you rotate the first, then the second is rotated at the double angle, the third -- triple.
    If you rotate the second, then the third is rotated at the double angle, the first -- triple.
    If you rotate the third, then the first is rotated at the double angle, the second -- triple.
    For example: You rotate the first lever at +10 degrees, then the second is rotated at +20 degrees and the third at +30 degrees.
</p>

<p>
    You can rotate the levers from -180 to +180 degrees only (but in interrelated mode it can be rotated at more than 360).
    You can rotate each lever once in the next order: the first, the second, the third.
    Sophie used the X-ray and found out what position it should be. After these rotations the levers must be at <strong>0, 225, 315</strong>.

<p>
    You are given a start position as three integers -- first, second, third.
    You should return a list of three integers -- the angles for each lever.
