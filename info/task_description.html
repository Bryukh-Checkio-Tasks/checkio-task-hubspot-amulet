    While exploring the island, Sofia found an interesting Amulet.
    Along the perimeter of the amulet small points are marked on each degree (for a total 360 degrees.)
    Three levers extrude from the amulet with varying lengths. 
    The first lever is the shortest, the second lever is in the middle of the three and the last is the longest.
    These levers can be rotated, but if you rotate one lever the others rotate as well.
    The levers rotate discretely by degrees, ratating them clockwise gives you a positive angle while counterclockwise is negative.
</p>

<p>
    After some experimentation, Sophie discovers how the levers correlate. 
    If you rotate a lever, the other rotate in the same direction but at different speeds.
    If you rotate the first, the second is rotated at the double angle while the third rotates at triple.
    If you rotate the second, the third is rotated at the double angle, and the first rotates at triple.
    If you rotate the third, the first is rotated at the double angle, and the second rotates at triple.
    For example: You rotate the first lever at +10 degrees. As a result, the second is rotated at +20 degrees and the third at +30 degrees.
</p>

<p>
    You can rotate the levers from -180 to +180 degrees only (but in interrelated mode it can be rotated more than 360 degrees).
    You can rotate each lever once in the following order: the first, the second, the third.
    Sophie used her X-ray vision and found out what position each lever should be in. 
    After completing these rotations, the levers must be at <strong>0, 225, 315</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    You are given the start position as three integers -- first, second, third.
    You should return a list of three integers -- the angles for each lever.
