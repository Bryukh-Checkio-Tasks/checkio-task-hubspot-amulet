    On the island Sophie found the interesting round amulet.
    Along the perimeter of the amulet has a small points through each degree (total 360).
    Also the amulet has three levers with different lengths
    (first is the shortest, second is middle and third is the longest).
    Levers can be rotated. If you rotate one lever, then rotate and others.
    The levers rotate discretely by degrees. Clockwise direction is a positive angle. Counterclockwise is a negative.

    After some experiments Sophie discovers the levers correlation. If you rotate a lever, then other rotate in the same direction but with different speed.<br>
    If you rotate the first, then the second is rotated at the <strong>f<sub>2</sub></strong> time faster, the third -- at the <strong>f<sub>3</sub></strong>time faster.<br>
    If you rotate the second, then the third is rotated at the <strong>s<sub>3</sub></strong> time faster, the first -- at the <strong>s<sub>1</sub></strong> time faster.<br>
    If you rotate the third, then the first is rotated at the <strong>t<sub>1</sub></strong> time faster, the second -- at the <strong>t<sub>2</sub></strong> time faster.<br>
    This correlation can be represented as a matrix 3x3 with <strong>1</strong> in the main diagonal.<br>
    <table class="matrix">
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>f<sub>2</sub></td>
        <td>f<sub>3</sub></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>s<sub>1</sub></td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>s<sub>3</sub></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>t<sub>1</sub></td>
        <td>t<sub>2</sub></td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>

    </table>
</div>

<div>
    For example, the rotating correlation is given as the matrix:
    <table  class="matrix">
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>

    </table>
    This mean that:<br>
    If you rotate the first, the second is rotated at the double angle while the third rotates at triple.<br>
    If you rotate the second, the third is rotated at the double angle, and the first rotates at triple.<br>
    If you rotate the third, the first is rotated at the double angle, and the second rotates at triple.<br>
    For example: You rotate the first lever at +10 degrees.
    As a result, the second is rotated at +20 degrees and the third at +30 degrees.
</div>

<p>
    You can rotate the levers from -180 to +180 degrees only (but in interrelated mode it can be rotated at more than 360).
    You can rotate each lever once in the next order: the first, the second, the third.
    Sophie used the X-ray and found out what position it should be. After these rotations the levers must be at <strong>0, 225, 315</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    You are given a rotation matrix as a list of lists with positive integers and the unitary main diagonal.
    You should return a list of three integers -- the angles for each lever.
    The start position of the levers is [0, 0, 0].
